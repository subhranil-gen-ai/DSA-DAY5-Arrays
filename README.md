# DSA-DAY5-Arrays
Sorting algorithms in Python – Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Built-in, and bonus logic problems. (DSA Day 5)

# Problems Covered
- Bubble Sort  
- Insertion Sort 
- Selection Sort  
- Built-in Sort  
- Descending Order Sort Using Built-in Functions 
- Descending Order Sort Manually 
- Sort Without Using Built-in Functions
- Sort by Absolute Values
- Sort Strings by Their Length 

# 📚 Concepts Practiced
- Bubble, Insertion, and Selection sort algorithms  
- Manual vs. built-in sorting  
- Sorting by condition, length, and absolute values  
- Sorting with constraints and custom logic  
- Time complexity awareness (O(n²), O(n log n), etc.)
